I'm a third year Phd student from [School of Electronic and Information Engineering](http://seie.hit.edu.cn/), [Harbin Institute of Technology](https://www.hit.edu.cn/). 

My research interest includes Radar target detection, random matrix theory (RMT), clutter modeling and CFAR detection. 

I am very fortunate to be advised by [Prof. Junhao Xie](https://homepage.hit.edu.cn/xiejunhao?lang=zh). 

You can find my CV here: [Jie Zhou's CV](ZhouJieCV.pdf).
